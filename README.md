# Fungiclassifiers

Fungiclassifiers is the official implementation of the classifiers two different models namely convolutional neural network 
(CNN) (LeCun et al. 2015) and deep belief network (DBN) (Hinton & Salakhutdinov 2006, Hinton et al. 2006) for fungal classification.

## Data
There are two datasets available as inputs for fungiclassifiers. The "small" dataset contains ~4000 ITS yeast sequences, checked and validated by the specialists at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. This dataset were analyzed and released in [Vu D. et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192050/). The "large" dataset contains ~350K ITS fungal sequences downloaded from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) which was used in [Vu D. et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06837) to evaluate the speed of MLC.

[yeast dataset](http://www.westerdijkinstitute.nl/Download/SmallDatasetOf4KYeastITSSequences.zip) the small demo dataset.

[top50 UNITE](https://github.com/vuthuyduong/fungiclassifiers/tree/master/data/top50UNITE) the large demo dataset.
